/**
 * An implementation of an optional value, similar to [Optional] with extra utilities
 *
 * An [Option] represents a value of type [T] which may or may not be present. presence is represented through child
 * classes [Some] which represents presence and [None] which represents absence. This interface is similar to Scala
 * or Rust's optional types.
 *
 * Option types are a nice alternative to nullable types for code which is expected to be called from Java. If we had
 * no intentions of support a Java ecosystem a nullable value would do just fine.
 *
 * Optionals also allow for basic error handling without usage of Java/Kotlin exceptions. One can simply return
 * [None] if an action failed to signal the absence of a result. If we need a more thorough and descriptive error
 * type which conveys more information we can use [Result].
 *
 * Because of the way sealed classes in Kotlin work we are able to get a very clean and easy-to-use interface for
 * optional values.
 *
